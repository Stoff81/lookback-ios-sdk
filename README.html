<h1>Lookback SDK for iOS</h1>

<p>Lookback is a tool and library for user experience testing that you can install into your app. Lookback records the iOS screen, the front-facing camera, microphone, metadata, touches and active views, and uploads it all in near-realtime to lookback.io where you can study and dive into the data.</p>

<p>Some use cases are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Remote research. Invite testers to test your app with just a
Participate link, and no additional setp.</li>
<li>User testing sessions. Instead of mounting web cams in your
testing lab to record both the screen and your tester's
reactions, let Lookback do the hard work for you.</li>
<li>Long-term usability study. Let a user record a week of
using your app, and study trends, reactions and recurring
problems.</li>
</ul>

<p>For more examples, see <a href="http://lookback.io/examples">the Lookback example videos site</a>.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<h3>Getting Lookback into your app</h3>

<p>The easiest way to add the Lookback SDK into your app is to use the <a href="http://cocoapods.org">CocoaPods package manager</a>. After setting up CocoaPods for your project, just add the following line to your Podfile:</p>

<pre><code>pod 'Lookback'
</code></pre>

<p>and run <code>pod install</code>.</p>

<p>If you would rather download the .framework and link to it manually, see the <a href="http://lookback.io/docs/install-using-cocoapods">manual installation guide online</a>.</p>
